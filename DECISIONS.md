# Decisions

One entry per consequential choice: what we chose, what we rejected, why.
Ordered chronologically.

## Phase 0

### D1 — Study window trimmed to 2017-01-01 – 2018-08-26

**Chose:** build the seller-week panel only from orders with
`order_purchase_timestamp` in `[2017-01-01, 2018-08-26]`; discard everything
outside it as if it were never collected.

**Rejected:** using the raw dataset's full span (2016-09-04 to 2018-10-17).

**Why:** the weekly order-volume plot (`figures/phase0_calendar_coverage.png`)
shows two artefacts, not signal:
- 2016-09 through 2016-12 is a soft-launch: one week of ~320 orders
  (2016-10-03/09), then near-silence until January 2017. A seller only
  active in this period is indistinguishable from a seller who onboarded
  and immediately churned — there's no surrounding data to tell the
  difference.
- The week of 2018-08-27 onward collapses from ~1,900 orders/week to
  double, then single, digits inside two weeks. This is the dataset export
  cutting off mid-collection, not a mass simultaneous merchant failure.

Including either range would make cessation and truncation indistinguishable
by construction. Trimming costs us ~0.5% of (order, seller) rows and some
real seller history from late 2016, which is a real cost — it's a tradeoff,
not a free cleanup, and it's why it's logged here rather than done silently
inside the panel code.

**Consequence:** `STUDY_END` (2018-08-26) doubles as the administrative
censoring point — any seller still active near it is right-censored, not
observed to fail, regardless of how long the remaining silence looks.

### D2 — Panel grain: one row per (seller_id, week), week = Mon–Sun ending Sunday

**Chose:** `pandas` `W-SUN` period, keyed off `order_purchase_timestamp`.
Panel starts at each seller's first order week (within the study window)
and runs to `STUDY_END`, including zero-order weeks explicitly.

**Why:** `order_purchase_timestamp` is the only order-table timestamp with
zero nulls (approval/carrier/delivery dates all have missing values), and
it's the earliest, most "as-of-safe" of the available timestamps — a good
anchor for later Phase 1 feature work.

**Consequence for multi-seller orders:** an order with items from more than
one seller produces one row per seller in the intermediate order-seller
frame; order-level fields (status, cancellation, delivery dates) are shared
across those rows since the raw data has no seller-specific order status.
This is a simplification — noted, not hidden.

### D3 — Eligibility filter for cessation-style definitions: ≥4 total orders and ≥3 distinct active weeks

**Chose:** a seller only enters the risk set for the cessation-based
candidates (A, B) if it placed at least 4 orders across at least 3 distinct
weeks within the study window. 1,919 of 3,065 sellers (62.6%) qualify.

**Rejected:** no floor (every seller with ≥1 order eligible).

**Why:** median seller lifetime spend is ~7 orders total and a quarter of
all sellers place only 1–2 orders ever. For those, "cessation" is not a
meaningful concept — a seller with one order trivially "ceases" the
following week regardless of health, since there was never a baseline
cadence to depart from. The threshold is a judgement call, not derived from
theory — **flagged for your sign-off**, along with the candidate-definition
choice in `PHASE0_FINDINGS.md`.

**Confirmed 2026-08-23, still an arbitrary default:** kept as-is. It
excludes 1,146 of 3,065 sellers (37.4% of the seller count) but only
$438,803 of $13,523,076 in-window GMV (3.2%). The floor is doing what it's
supposed to — dropping a large share of sellers who each carry almost no
revenue — but the specific numbers 4 and 3 are still not derived from
anything beyond "median seller places ~7 orders total," and should be
revisited if Phase 1/2 results look sensitive to it.

### D5 — Carry N=4, N=8, N=12 through to Phase 4 as a robustness check

**Chose:** N=8 weeks of silence is the primary pure-cessation definition
(665 events, 65.4% censoring — see D3-confirmed numbers and
`PHASE0_FINDINGS.md`), but N=4 and N=12 are not dropped after Phase 0. All
three get carried through Phase 1–4 so the headline lead-time/economic
results can be checked for sensitivity to N, not reported against a single
arbitrarily-chosen threshold.

**Why:** N was chosen from the empirical gap distribution between a still-
active seller's consecutive order weeks (90th pct = 5 weeks, 95th = 8,
99th = 18) as "unusual enough to signal exit," but that's still a judgement
call on a noisy distribution, not a hard boundary — worth confirming the
downstream conclusions don't flip on it.

### D6 — Right-edge event confirmation: flagged, not yet mitigated

**Finding:** under pure cessation, 22–35% of confirmed events (depending on
N) have their confirmation date in just the last N weeks before
`STUDY_END` — a calendar-time window that is 5–14% of the full 86-week
study, not 22–35% of it. The weekly hazard rate also visibly spikes in the
final few weeks before `STUDY_END` for every N tested (see
`figures/phase0_calendar_hazard.png`, `FAILURES.md` F4). Trimming to
`STUDY_END` (D1) removed the calendar-volume truncation artefact but did
not remove a second, subtler one: events confirmed with the bare-minimum
N-week margin cluster right where that margin is thinnest.

**Not yet resolved** — see the open question raised alongside this file's
delivery. Whatever is decided must be applied consistently before Phase 2's
time-based train/test split, since the later (test) window is exactly where
this artefact concentrates.

### D4 — "Elevated" quality thresholds: trailing 4-week cancel rate > 0.10 OR late-delivery rate > 0.50

**Chose:** these two cutoffs, applied to a trailing 4-week pooled rate
(sum of cancellations or late deliveries over the last 4 weeks, divided by
sum of orders/deliveries over the same weeks — not a mean of weekly rates,
which would be dominated by weeks with 1–2 orders).

**Why these numbers:** chosen from the empirical cross-sectional
distribution of trailing rates across all active-seller-weeks, roughly the
99th percentile for cancellation and 95th for late-delivery (see
`FAILURES.md` for why cancellation needed a much more extreme cutoff to
mean anything). Not a theoretically derived number — a candidate default,
open to revision once we see how much it drives Candidate A's event count
(see `PHASE0_FINDINGS.md`).

**Trailing window = 4 weeks:** chosen to match the Phase 1 trend-window
convention (brief specifies trailing-4-week slopes for feature trends), so
the same window means the same thing in the label definition and in the
features that will later predict it.
